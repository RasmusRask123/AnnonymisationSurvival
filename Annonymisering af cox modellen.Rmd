# Annonymisation of Survival Data 

One of the issues that's arising when working with survival data is that sensitive patients information, such as age, sex time of death, etc. is shared with unauthorized personnel. In the era of       

```{r}
library(survival)
library(survminer)
data(cancer, package="survival")
```



```{r}
ggsurvplot(
    fit = survfit(Surv(time, status) ~ sex, data = lung), 
    xlab = "Days", 
    ylab = "Overall survival probability")
```
```{r}

coxph(Surv(time,status)~age+sex+ph.ecog+ph.karno+wt.loss,data=lung )

```
